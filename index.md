## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3 
This was my favorite lab because it made us calculate the BMR (Basal, Metobolic Rate) of different people by using equations to calculat their weight, height, and age. This lab was really interesting because it associated with real world problems people have.

Lab 7 
This was a really interesting lab because it made us utilize bool statements with if statements inside to calculate what time and day you can park. This was a challenging lab, but once I figured it out it was realy fun and very interactive.

Lab 8 part 2
This lab was one of my favorite labs to do because part 2 made us create the game poker. This program was really fun to do because it made us think how to code if the player was guessing high or low or if they win ans lose.
